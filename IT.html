                    <h3>Cloud</h3>
                    <p>Cloud servers came into fruition in the 1960s by Joseph Carl Robnett Locklider, 
                        he was a phycologist and computer science that wanted to connect people all over the world. 
                        By the 2000s, technology powerhouse companies such as Amazon and Microsoft were introducing 
                        their own cloud computing services (Educba). </p>
                    <p>Modern cloud services allow companies to make resources accessible to people over a remote 
                        network or online interface. We may not realise how often we use these things in our 
                        everyday life, from school to work and even at home, these services make things such as 
                        accessing school resources via a school portal, working remotely, and syncing your information 
                        across all your devices. This means that the cloud servers are the heart of any cloud computing 
                        service, and they can be delivered in multiple ways, Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a 
                        Service or Software as a Service and Function as a Service, the platform can also be deployed in
                        different ways depending on the enterprise’s preferences. They can be deployed in a public way 
                        the third part provider makes the resource available to the general public over the internet, 
                        an example of this service is the Google Cloud. It can be also deployed in a private way where 
                        an enterprise will use a proprietary architecture and will run  the cloud with its own data centre, 
                        the enterprise will have their own hardware on premises and have all control of underlying cloud
                        infrastructure. Lastly, they can also be deployed in a hybrid way which combines features of both 
                        public and private.</p>
                    <p>Cloud severs come into existence through a process called virtualisation which makes use of a 
                        software called a hypervisor also known as a virtual machine monitor, this software creates 
                        and supports multiple virtual machines by creating one host computer capable of running multiple 
                        guest virtual machines. It divides and shares the resources of the host computer such as its 
                        memory and processors. In a public setting the resources are split and used by multiple organisations 
                        and/or individuals, with dedicated private servers, owners or renters are provided with their own 
                        physical server which the hypervisor virtualises but does not split the resources.</p>
                    <p>As technology continues to evolve, these virtual machines will likely become much more secure, 
                        with security systems becoming more integrated with AI and machine learning, this will help 
                        automate all the processes of threat prevention as well as risk detection. We will also likely 
                        find ourselves to become more integrated with technology with things such as Internet of Things 
                        (IoT) technology which allows someone to manage all their smart devices from a central hub and 
                        Multi-cloud platforms which would allow people to integrate all their cloud providers into one 
                        central space. One of the largest growing platforms for the cloud service is serverless computing 
                        also known as Function as a Service, this is where developers do not need to manage the cloud 
                        server and all they need to do is write and deploy their application code.</p>
                    <p>The continued development of this sector of technology means we will likely mean we will continue
                        to become more intwined with technology we will see the positive and negatives of this relationship 
                        between societies growing dependence on technology. In 2021, Nassim Khadem reported that the Australian 
                        Cyber Security Centre received a cybercrime report at least once every 10 minutes which turns out to be 
                        approx. 164 a day, we will likely see this number rise with cybercrimes such as malware installation 
                        where people might unknowingly download a resource from an unsecure cloud server that contains a computer 
                        virus which could possibly lead to these people having personal information stolen which thus may lead 
                        to identity theft. This will greatly affect many people in their day to day lives as well as the 
                        possibility of these people’s jobs going redundant. Jobs such as accountants, assembly line workers, 
                        bank tellers are among some of the careers that are susceptible to the advancements of technology. 
                        There are also jobs that will be more sought after such as software developers and Customer Experience 
                        Specialists and online teachers as well as some jobs that will need to be instated such as 3D Printer 
                        technicians, smart home designers and human-machine team managers. </p>
                    <p>For people like us, this innovation in the IT sector makes it possible to broaden one’s horizons, even 
                        though it currently feels like there are many pathways to go down those pathways will continue to split 
                        and new pathways will be created. This should excite people in the IT world with the possibility of 
                        creating new things and discovering more about what possibilities there are. The future development of 
                        cloud servers will mean that people like me will have easier access to resources needed for things such 
                        as school and work and will likely mean that as our careers progress, we will likely be able to work from 
                        anywhere in the world. While this might excite people in IT, this might make others worried, as generations 
                        continue to change, technology does with it, older generations start feeling more and more out of the loop 
                        with the newest tech. They might feel like they do not know how to integrate their lives with the new 
                        technology coming out, at least I know that the older generations in my family do. Nevertheless, technology 
                        will keep evolving and we will move with it. </p>
